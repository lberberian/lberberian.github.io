<p> I am a third year student at Occidental College.
I love long walks on the beach,
Short walks to my refrigerator,
dogs, specifically boston terriers, golden doodles, and pugs.
I am an environmental enthusiast and paleontologist.
I conduct research on Soil Erosion in the Highlands of Iceland. </p>

<p>My expected graduation date is May 2020.</p>
